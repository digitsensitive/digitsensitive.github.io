The problem raises the question whether a given point in the plane lies inside, outside or on the boundary of a polygon. This is in particular a basic operation in computer graphics.
The article cannot be considered as a fully comprehensive coverage of every aspect of the problem. Errors cannot be excluded. Corrections or additions are always desired and welcome.</description></item><item><title>Lua</title><link>https://digitsensitive.github.io/notes/lua/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2022 07:41:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://digitsensitive.github.io/notes/lua/</guid><description>Comments -- simple one liner --[[ multiline comment ]] Variables In lua every variable is by default global, which is a historical decision.
